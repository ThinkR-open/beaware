and `system.file()` to read it in your examples 
-->


# Récupérer les informations pour monitorer

```{r examples}
get_process_rsession()
```

# Get cpu and mem info

```{r examples-2}
get_mem_cpu()
```

# Get r info

```{r examples-3}
pids <- get_process_rsession()
get_r_version(pids$pid)
```

# Get all info

```{r examples-4}
get_all_info()
```

If take too much time

```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(get_all_info())
```
